The purpose of this repo is to get you familiar with TypeScript while also
helping you practice TDD (Test Driven Development)

For each exercise, make a directory in `src/` with a descriptive name (if it's
not already there) for the exercise, then make the following inside:
  - `index.ts` - will contain the code to write
  - `index.test.tsx` - will contain the tests for the code in `index.ts`
